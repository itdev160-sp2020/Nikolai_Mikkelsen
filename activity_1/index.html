    <h1>Should I use VS 2019 vs. VS Code for this class?</h1>
    <P1>I am most interested in learning to utilize Visual Studio for application development I am also planning on a <a href="https://magento.com/"> Magento Ecommerce </a> build in the near future.</P1>
    <p></p>
    <br />A couple searches of the internet turned up a few reasons to consider using Visual Studio vs. VS Code.<br>
    <hr />
    <h2>Visual Studio</h2>
    <hr />
    <UL>
        <LI><strong>As the name indicates, it is an IDE, and it contains all the features required for project development. Like code auto completion, debugger, database integration, server setup, configurations, and so on.</strong></LI>
        <p></p>
        <LI><strong>It is a complete solution mostly used by and for .NET related developers. It includes everything from source control to bug tracker to deployment tools, etc. It has everything required to develop.</strong></LI>
        <p></p>
        <LI><strong>It is widely used on .NET related projects (though you can use it for other things). The community version is free, but if you want to make most of it then it is not free.</strong></LI>
        <p></p>
        <li><strong>Visual Studio is aimed to be the world’s best IDE (integrated development environment), which provide full stack develop toolsets, including a powerful code completion component called IntelliSense, a debugger which can debug both source code and machine code, everything about ASP.NET development, and something about SQL development.</strong></li>
        <p></p>
        <li><strong>In the latest version of Visual Studio, you can develop cross-platform application without leaving the IDE. And Visual Studio takes more than 8 GB disk space (according to the components you select).</strong></li>
        <p></p>
        <li><strong>In brief, Visual Studio is an ultimate development environment, and it’s quite heavy.</strong></li>
    </UL>
    <hr />
    <h2>Visual Studio Code</h2>
    <hr />
    <UL>
        <LI><strong>It's a lightweight source code editor which can be used to view, edit, run, and debug source code for applications.</strong></LI>
        <p></p>
        <LI><strong>Simply it is Visual Studio without the Visual UI, majorly a superman’s text-editor.</strong></LI>
        <p></p>
        <LI><strong>It is mainly oriented around files, not projects.</strong></LI>
        <p></p>
        <li><strong>It does not have any scaffolding support.</strong></li>
        <p></p>
        <li><strong>It is a competitor of Sublime Text or Atom on Electron.</strong></li>
        <p></p>
        <li><strong>It is based on the Electron framework, which is used to build cross platform desktop application using web technologies.</strong></li>
        <p></p>
        <li><strong> It does not have support for Microsoft's version control system; Team Foundation Server.</strong></li>
        <p></p>
        <li><strong> It has limited IntelliSense for Microsoft file types and similar features.</strong></li>
        <p></p>
        <li><strong> It is mainly used by developers on a Mac who deal with client-side technologies (HTML, JavaScript, and CSS).</strong></li>
    </UL>
